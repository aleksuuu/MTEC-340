# My Favorite Game

My favorite game is *Inside*, a puzzle-platform game developed by [Playdead](https://playdead.com). I have always enjoyed both platformers and puzzle games, and *Inside* combines the two genres well. The music and graphics are exquisitely crafted, often evoking an inexplicable amount of fear. The game was initially released on June 29, 2016 for Xbox One. It uses Unity.
